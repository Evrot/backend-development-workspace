# Application Development 1: Backend

Hi, my name is Danniel Franco, and I'm glad you are here!

 This repository is designated for my app development class, but it will also serve to track all my progress from beginning to end. Seat belts on, because it is coding time!

 ## Learning Objectives
 1. Learn in-depth about REST APIs.
 2. Master Git and GitHub features, and understand even more the importance of version control.
 3. Create my own app.
 4. Develop a solid knowledge of all the topics presented in the course, so I can be a more competitive professional.

 *Expectations for this repository*
 I am planning to use it as a place where I will upload my assignments and keep track of them, and at the end of the semester, I'll have a clear understanding of how much I have evolved.
